# Disney Plus Utility

This Chrome extension automatically presses the "Skip Intro" and "Next episode" buttons on Disney Plus, enhancing your viewing experience by eliminating the need to manually skip intros.

## Usage

### Auto Skip Intro/Next Episode
Once the extension is installed, it will automatically detect when you are watching a show or movie on Disney Plus. When the "Skip Intro" button appears, the extension will click it for you, allowing you to jump straight into the content.
You can enable/disable the automatic skipping if you click on the extensions icon.

### Sleep Timer
Due to the automatic skipping of intros, Disney Plus will think the user is active and never or rarely stop automatically. So if you go to sleep with your favorite show running and Auto Skip enabled, Disney Plus will never stop and you will wake up with your show still running. To counter this use the sleep timer functionality and let the extension pause the video for you after a set delay.
